## Java Projects

I have developed all the games listed under Java Projects to make them easier to code for students. None of the games use any sprites; they are all rendered by making draw calls directly onto JPanels. A couple of non-game related projects are listed first.

The game cloned the mechanics of Chip's Challenge while also adding new enemies, mechanics, and a level editor. I was responsible for managing the team, approving code merges, developing the core game systems, including data structures and methods for the editor, and designing custom levels, among other roles.
* **XNA Tools** ([Github Link](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/XNATools)): XNA Tools is a framework for simplifying development in XNA. Developed from some code I wrote part of Chad's Challenge, and then used in Kirby Arena, Splashboard, my Honour's project, and a number of other projects.

* **Splashboard** ([Vimeo Example Gameplay](https://vimeo.com/user19868725)) (Kinect Virtual Art Program): Not a program I developed myself, but I provided my XNA Tools as the framework and assisted with converting the original C++ code into C#. Along with extending the library to provide additional support for necessary functions requested.

I developed custom algorithms with three games that effectively used the inputs and tested them on participants.

## Unity Projects

* **Experiment 1**: ([Github Link](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/PhD-First-Experiment)) ([Youtube Demo](https://youtu.be/OF3ZlTPa5rg)): A prelimary study into using VR for object manipulation and interaction.

My roles involved project manager, lead programmer, lead AI programmer, lead tester, co-lead documentation editor, and I was responsible for other elements such as merging the work of others into a single cohesive project. The game puts you in the Stargate setting with many ships and many more planets to travel to and attack or defend as an Earth faction player. 

* **Unity Workshop 1**: ([Github Link](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/IntroductionWorkshop)): Materials I developed to teach introduction to Unity. This workshop focuses on setting up the environment, creating objects, using prefabs, and introducing scripting.
* **Unity Workshop 2**: ([Github Link](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/Unity2DPlatformerWorkshop)): Materials I developed to teach introduction to Unity. This workshop teaches the creation of a simple Platformer game. Additional extension topics include a procedurally generated platformer level, introduction to using the debugger and using GitHub on Windows with Unity. 
* **Unity Workshop 3**: ([Github Link](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/ThirdWorkshopDemoProject)): Materials I developed to teach introduction to Unity. In this workshop, I showed a breakdown of tower defence game components, a tower defence game, examples of using events in Unity, procedural generation of a dungeon in Unity with some talk about types of randomisation, and general tips for managing objects with principles to follow.
* **Unity Workshop 4**: ([Github Link](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/FourthWorkshopDemoProject)): Materials I developed to teach introduction to Unity. In this final workshop, I showed examples of coroutines, using scriptable objects, examples of programming patterns used in game design (singleton pattern, observer pattern, command pattern, component pattern, flyweight pattern, and state pattern) and SOLID Principles with examples. To use the concepts taught, I also included a partial sample game based on mimicking Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes using scriptable objects and coroutines to make a lot of the functionality.

## Other Projects

* **CASIO Calculator Applications**: ([Github Link](https://github.com/Squirrelbear/CasioApplications)): This contains a collection of Casio applications I wrote while in highschool.
